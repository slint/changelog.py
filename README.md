# changelog.py

Generate a changelog summary from changes in Python dependencies.

This script compares your `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile.lock`
with its previously committed state to determines what packages have
been updated. It then fetches the commit history for each package
and generates a nicely formatted changelog to help you understand
if there are breaking changes, new features, bug fixes, etc.

## Installation

Make sure you have [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed.

```bash
# Clone this repo (or directly download `changelog.py`)
git clone git@github.com:slint/changelog.py.git
cd changelog.py

# Make sure `changelog.py` is in your PATH (e.g. via symlinking)
ln -s "$(realpath changelog.py)" "$HOME/.local/bin/changelog.py"
```

## Usage

```bash
# Running the following in a local clone of https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo-rdm
changelog.py --package-filter "invenio" --since v7.3.0 --until v7.4.0

# ...or e.g. if you have local changes
changelog.py --package-filter "invenio" --since HEAD
```

...will output:
